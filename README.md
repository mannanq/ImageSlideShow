###Image Slideshow - JavaFX

This is a simple image slideshow project in JavaFX. 
##Some issues I faced during this task include but not limited to:

### Repretitive boiler plate code
### For this task, managine state was relatively simple. However if a similar 
### application grows in scope, managing the state could prove difficult in the way it is implemented here
### I currently do not have unit tests for the task. So there could be issues or bugs I may have overlooked
